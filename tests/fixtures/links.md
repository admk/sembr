# Links and References Test

This is a paragraph with [inline links](https://example.com) and [reference links][1] that should be wrapped properly without breaking the link syntax or interfering with the link formatting.

Here is another paragraph with a very long link [this is a link with a long title that should not be broken](https://example.com/very/long/url/that/should/remain/intact) in the middle of text.

This paragraph has multiple links: [first link](https://first.com), [second link](https://second.com), and [third link](https://third.com) that should all be preserved during wrapping.

[1]: https://example.com "Reference link with long title that should be preserved"
[2]: https://another-example.com "Another reference"

Regular paragraph that references multiple links[1][2] in sequence.
