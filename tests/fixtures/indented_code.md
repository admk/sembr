# Indented Code Blocks Test

Regular paragraph before code block that should be wrapped normally.

    This is an indented code block
    that should be preserved exactly
    without any semantic line breaking
    even if lines are very long and would normally be wrapped by the semantic line breaking algorithm

Another regular paragraph after the code block that should be wrapped normally with semantic line breaks applied as expected.
