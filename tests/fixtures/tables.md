# Tables Test

| Column 1 | Column 2 with very long content that might need special handling but should not be wrapped |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2 with long text that should not be wrapped by SemBr and should remain on one line  |
| Short    | Another cell with moderate length content that should also remain intact                  |

Regular paragraph after table that should be wrapped normally with semantic line breaks applied properly.
