# Complex Inline Formatting Test

This paragraph has **bold text that spans multiple words and should be wrapped while preserving the bold formatting**, *italic text that is also quite long and should maintain italic formatting*, and `inline code that should not be broken or modified` in various combinations throughout the text.

Here is text with nested formatting: **bold with *italic inside* and more bold text** that should be handled correctly during wrapping.

Another paragraph with `inline code that is quite long and should remain unbroken`, followed by **bold text**, and then *italic text that continues for several words* to test complex combinations.

Text with strikethrough ~~this is struck through text that should be preserved~~ and more formatting combinations.
